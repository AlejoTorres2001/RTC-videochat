  **this is the master branch for the client code of this implementation of the *RTC-videochat***
  

</div>

Both **Backend** and **Frontend** should be considered as separated projects each one with its dependencies. if you are about to contribute to this project or just to play around with the code I suggest cloning each master branch in different folders

## About The Project

a react app that displays you video stram, allows yuo to copy you Socket ID, initiate and end calls between peers
I would like to point out that the session of the user is handled inside the memory of the client (state) using the ContextAPI, only storing the refreshToken in a HTTPS-only cookie.
I'm using LocalStorage just to handle the check of a trust device.
